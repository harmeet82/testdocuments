As part of Social Value Week, London is proud to be organising a community-focused litter pick in Tower Hamlets, targeting lesser-served urban spaces - areas that often go unnoticed compared to our parks and canals. This initiative is part of our ongoing commitment to environmental responsibility and local community engagement.

The event will take place from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, with all litter-picking equipment provided. Volunteers from across the business will have the opportunity to contribute to a cleaner, greener borough while also connecting with colleagues and partners from CGI and BJSS. It's a great way to get involved in Social Impact Week, meet new people, and showcase our CGI’s commitment to sustainability.
